## Ethical and Professional Standards

### Ethics and trust in the investment profession

#### 1. Ethics explaination
Ethics: a set of shared beliefs about what is good or acceptance behavior and what is bad or unacceptable behavior

improve outcomes for stakeholders

#### 2. Challenges to ethical behavior

个人会倾向于过高平均追剧的道德水平，在决定他们的道德标准时过度强调他们自己的个人特点。

Situational influences在道德约束方面比内在的个人品质更重要, 其中包括 social pressure from others

#### 3. Need for ethical standard




#### 4. Ethical and legal standards

Ethical decisions require more judgment and consideration of the impact of behavior on many stakeholders compared to legal decisions.

#### 5. Framework for ethical decision making

1. Identify
2. Consider
3. Decide and act
4. Reflect

### Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct

The structure of the CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program

The process for the enforcement of the Code and Standards

6 components of the Code of Ethics

7 standards of Prodessional Conduct

Ethical responsibilities required by the Code and Standards

### Guidance for Standards



### Introduction to the Global Investment Performance Standards

The reason why the GIPS standards were created

The parties the GIPS standards apply to

The group served by the standards

Construction and purpose of composites in performance reporting

The requirements for verification

### The GIPS Standards

Key features of the GIPS standards

Fundamentals of compliance

Scope of the GIPS standards

#### Conflict between the GIPS standards and local regulations

In any case where country-specific regulations conflict with GIPS, firms must follow the applicable country-specific regulations but must also disclose the nature of the conflict with GIPS

#### 9 major sections of the GIPS standards

## Quantitative Methods

### Time value of money

Nominal risk-free rate = real risk-free rate + expected inflation rate

Required interest rate on a security = nominal risk-free rate + default risk premium + liquidity premium + maturity risk premium

EAR (Effective annual rate) = (1+ stated annual rate/m)^m -1

Continurous compounding:

e^r - 1 = EAR

r = ln(EAR + 1)

Future value (interest) factor: 

(1 + I/Y)^N

### Discounted cash flow applications

HPR (Holding period return)= (ending value + cash flow received)/beginning value + 1

Money-weighted rate of return: IRR of the cash flow

Time-weighted rate of return = [(1+HPR1)*(1+HPR2)...]^(1/n-1)

It is the geometric mean return.

BDY (Bank discount yield): (D/F)*(360/t)

- D = face value - purchase value
- F = face value
- t= days remaining until maturity

HPY (Holding period yield)=(P1 + D1)/P0 - 1

EAY (Effective annual yield)= (1+HPY)^(365/n) - 1

**Money market yield (CD equivalent yield): rMM = HPY * (360/t) = 360 * BDY/(360 - t * BDY)**

Bond equivalent yield = 2* semiannual discount rate = [(1+EAY)^0.5-1]*2

### Statistical concepts and market returns

Population mean, sample mean are all arithmetic means.

几何平均数经常用于计算多期复合增长率。

Geometric mean=(X1 * X2 * ...* Xn)^(1/n)

Harmonic mean 用于计算平均每股购买成本

Quantile:

- Quartile-- quarters
- Quintile-- fifths
- Decile-- tenths
- Percentile-- percents

CV (coefficient of variation) = standard deviation / average value

The sharp ratio = (rp-rf)/σp

Skewness:

- Symmetrical

Mean = Median = Mode

- Positive(right) skew

Mean > Median > Mode

- Negative(left) skew

Mean < Median < Mode

### Probability concepts

Mutually exclusive: cannot happen at the same time

Exhaustive: include all possible outcomes

P(A | B)=P(AB)/P(B)

Correlation coefficient= Covarience/ (sigma(A)+sigma(B))

### Common probability distributions

Monte carlo simulation: randomly generated values for risk factors

limitation: Complex, no better than assumption used

Historical simulation: randomly selected past changes in risk factors

limitation: cannot consider the effects of significant events that did not occur in the sample period

### Sample amd estimation

Time-series data
Cross-sectional data
Longitudinal data
Panel data

Central limit theorem

Bias:

- Data mining bias
- Sample selection bias
- Survivorship bias
- Look-ahead bias
- Time-period bias


### Hypothesis testing

Type | Errors: rejection of null when it is true

Type || Errors: failure to reject the null when it is false


### Technical analysis

Price-based indicator:

- Moving average lines
- Bollinger bands

Non-price-based indicator:

- Sentiment indicator
	- Put/call ratio
	- Volatility Index
	- Margin debt
	- Short interest ratio

- Flow of funds
	- Arms index or short-term trading index
	- Margin debt
	- Mutual fund cash position
	- New equity issuance

Cycle:
Elliott Wave Patterns


## Corporate Finance

### Corporate governance

#### 1. Shareholder Theory

##### 1.1 Stakeholder:

- Shareholder: claim to net asset after liability
- Senior managers
- Employee
- Creditor: including owners of bonds and banks
- Supplier

##### 1.2 Principal-agent Conflict:

- Shareholders and managers or directors : information asymmetry
- Single and group of shareholders
- Creditors and shareholders
- Shareholders and other stakeholders

##### 1.3 Stakeholder management 

Infrastructure:

- Legal infrastructure
- Contractual infrastructure
- Organizational infrastructure
- Governmental infrastructure

Election:

- Member
  - Majority voting
  - Cumulative voting 
- Board
  - All member same meeting
  - Staggered board

##### 1.4 Board of directors

Board structure:

- One tier
  - Internal/Executive directors
  - External board members(non-executive directors): employee(mostly)
- Two tier
  - Supervisory board
  - Management board:
     - Typically led by CEO
     - Lead independent directors 

Board responsibility

Board committee:

- Audit committee
- Governance committee
- Nominations committee
- Compensation/remuneration committee
- Risk committee

## Fixed Income

### Bond prices, yields, and ratings

#### 1. Feature of a fixed-income security

- Issuer of the bond
- Maturity date of the bond
- Par value
- Coupon rate and frequency
- Currency

##### 1.1 Issuer of Bond
- Corporations
- Sovereign national governments(U.S. and other countries)
- Nonsorvereign governments(State or city)
- Quasi-government entities(Freddy and Fannie)
- Supranational entities

##### 1.2 Bond Maturities

Term to maturity(tenor): the remaining time until maturity

Perpetual bonds: bonds with no maturity date

Money market securities: YTM <=1yr

Capital market securities: YTM >1yr

##### 1.3 Par Value

Principle repaid at maturity

- Premium: Price > Par

- At par: Price = Par

- Discount: Price < Par

##### 1.4 Coupon Payments

Conventional bond (Plain vanilla): A bond with a fixed coupon rate

Zero-coupon bonds (pure discount bonds): Bonds paying no interests prior to maturity

##### 1.5 Currencies
Dual-currency bond: Bond with coupon interest in one currency and principle in another

Currency option bond: Bond with a choice for bondholders to decide which currency tehy want to receive

#### 2. Bond indenture

Trust deed(bond indenture契约): legal contract between the bond issuer and bondholders

Covenants(契约): Provisions in the bond indenture

- Negative covenants:restrictions on asset sales, negative pledge of collateral, restrictions on additional borrowings

保护债券持有人，保证债券违约率不提高

- Affirmative covenants: no restrictions on issuer's operating decision

#### 3. Issuance and trading of fixed-income securities

Bond Issue country:

Domestic Bonds: Domestic company, currency, market

Foreign Bonds: Foreign company, domestic currency, market

- Panda bonds
- Yankee bonds
- Samurai bonds

Eurobonds: A company, B currency， C market

Global bonds: A company, B currency， C market, trade in D market

- Bearer bond: ownership of bonds by possessing the bonds
- Registered bonds:ownership of bonds is recorded

Legal and regulatory issues in a trust:

- Legal information about the entity
-  Assets pledged for repayment
-  Additional features increasing the repayment probability
-  Covenants including actions to take and prohibited from taking

##### 3.1 Issuing Entities

Treasury of the country -> sovereign bonds

Well-known corporation -> corporate bonds

Special purpose entities(in U.S.)/vehicles(in Europe)(called bankruptcy remote vehicles) -> securitized bonds

SPE可以比相同的公司债发行更低的利率，因为SPE持有资产，即使公司破产了也能支付。

##### 3.2 Sources of Repayment

Sovereign bonds <- tax receipts of the country

Non sovereign bonds <- general taxes, revenues of projects(airports), special taxes or fees

Corporate bonds <- cash from firm's operations

Securitized bonds <- cash flow from the financial assets by SPE

##### 3.3 Collateral and Credit Enhancements

Collateral: assets pledged to support a bond issue

Unsecured bonds: bonds with no collateral

Secured bonds: bonds with collateral

Secured bonds 因为有collateral降低了违约风险，所以收益率降低

破产或者变现资产时，顺序为：Secured bonds, senior unsecured debt, subordinated/junior debt

Secured debt type:

- Equipment trust certificates: backed by equipment like railroad cars and oil drilling rigs
- Collateral trust bonds: backed by financial assets like stocks and bonds

Debenture 在英国和某些国家指有特定资产抵押的债券，在美国和其他国家指无抵押债券

Securitized bond 最常见是MBS，mortgage-backed security

Covered bonds类似于MBS，底层资产存于发行公司报表上（区别于SPE)

Credit enhancement: internal or external

Internal methods:

- overcollateralization
- cash reserve fund 
- excess spread account
- bond division into tranches

External methods:

- surety bonds
- bank guarantees
- letter of credit

#### 4. Taxation of Bond Income


Bonds issued by municipal governments in the U.S. exempt from income tax
